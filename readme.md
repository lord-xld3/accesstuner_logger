This software is currently being developed for automatic MAF calibration curve generation. Currently in an indev state. Multiple running branches and testing different methods. We are mostly working on running the calibration through GPU hardware acceleration using GLSL
Currently using an accessport for testing data logs, multiple loggging devices might be supported in the future.

So far the file selection is static and hard coded during development as datalog1
